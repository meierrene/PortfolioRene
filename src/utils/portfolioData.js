        "Flying has been my passion and profession for over a decade. As a fleet captain at Azul Airlines, I have accumulated more than 5000 flight hours, mastering the skies in various aircraft, including the Embraer E195 E1/E2, Airbus A320/A321, and ATR 42/72 series. My aviation journey has taken me through diverse operations, from regional flights to international routes, always ensuring safety, precision, and excellence. Beyond piloting, I am skilled in flight operations, crew resource management (CRM), aviation regulations, and procedural optimizations. I thrive in high-pressure environments, making split-second decisions while leading teams to execute flawless flights.",

        "Technology has always intrigued me, leading me to specialize in software development alongside my aviation career. I focus on web and mobile applications, mastering JavaScript, React.js, React Native, Node.js, and MongoDB to build scalable, high-performance solutions. Some of my key projects include MeiersBook, a social platform integrating authentication and data security; The Wild Oasis, a full-stack React & Next.js application for guest management; and AeroRoster, an in-progress airline crew scheduling tool integrating aviation regulations, flight plans, and meteorological data. I'm also expanding my skill set by learning TypeScript, Python, and C#, with a long-term goal of developing a post-apocalyptic co-op RPG in Unity.",
