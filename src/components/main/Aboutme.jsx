          Hey!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Greetings, Earthlings! I’m René Meier, an airline captain with a
          cosmic passion for technology and space exploration. After navigating
          the skies as a pilot, I’ve set my sights on a new frontier-full-stack
          development. My journey from the cockpit to coding has been fueled by
          curiosity, a love for problem-solving, and an unquenchable thirst for
          innovation. With a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, I’ve
          always been fascinated by how things work, whether it’s an aircraft or
          a complex web application. Over the past few years, I’ve ventured into
          the vast universe of JavaScript technologies, mastering React,
          Node.js, and CSS frameworks. My portfolio, themed around my love for
          outer space, showcases a variety of projects that reflect both my
          technical skills and my passion for exploration—like a quasi-replica
          of the Super Mario game and a full-stack social platform. Fluent in
          Portuguese, German, and English, and with a star map of basic
          knowledge in Italian, Swedish, and Finnish, I’m on a mission to
          contribute to innovative projects in the Nordic region, Europe, or
          North America. I’m ready to launch into the next phase of my career,
          bringing the same precision and dedication from my aviation background
          to the tech industry. When I’m not coding or flying, you can find me
          gazing at the stars, exploring the latest in space technology, or
          learning new languages. Let’s connect and explore the possibilities of
          working together. Because in this universe, the sky is not the limit.
