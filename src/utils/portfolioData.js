        "Flying has been my passion and profession for over a decade. As a fleet captain at Azul Airlines, I have accumulated more than 5000 flight hours, mastering the skies in various aircraft, including the Embraer E195 E1/E2, Airbus A320/A321, and ATR 42/72 series. My aviation journey has taken me through diverse operations, from regional flights to international routes, always ensuring safety, precision, and excellence. Beyond piloting, I am skilled in flight operations, crew resource management (CRM), aviation regulations, and procedural optimizations. I thrive in high-pressure environments, making split-second decisions while leading teams to execute flawless flights.",

        "My passion for technology led me to explore software development, where I specialize in web and mobile applications. With expertise in JavaScript, React.js, React Native, Node.js, and MongoDB, I focus on building efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solutions. Some of my key projects include MeiersBook, a social platform integrating authentication and data security; The Wild Oasis, a full-stack application using React.js and Next.js for managing guest accommodations; and AeroRoster, an ongoing project designed for airline crew scheduling, integrating aviation regulations, flight plans, and meteorological data. Beyond web development, I have a strong interest in game development, and I am currently learning C# and Unity to build a post-apocalyptic co-op RPG. Additionally, I am expanding my skills in TypeScript, Python, and React Native, further enhancing my ability to develop robust and versatile applications across different platforms.",

I love traveling to explore new cultures, walking through forests to reconnect with nature, and enjoying cold weather with sauna and cold-water swimming. Cycling is my way of staying active, while at home, I unwind by playing video games on my PC. Occasionally, I fire up the grill for a barbecue, enjoying good food with family.",
